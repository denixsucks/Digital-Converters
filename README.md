# Digital-Converters


WARNING : This is the Alpha version. Some systems doesn't work properly.


This is my homework for digital system design class. Our teacher gave us 2 weeks to finish this so there are lots of bugs and i didnt optimize the code. I wrote with Maven Java. I didnt have time but I'll get back to this later on and fix the issues. Feel free to use the codes.


This program includes:

- BCD , Excess-3 , Aiken , Gray to Decimal and Decimal to BCD , Excess-3 , Aiken , Gray Converter (Aiken to Decimal and Gray to Decimal doesn't work right now.)
- Base to base number conversion
- Addition and Subtraction operations with base (It's working but sometimes it gives errors.)
- Complement to 1 and Complement to 2
- Quantization and Sensitivity in Analog to Digital Converter
- Digital to Analog Conversion Table
